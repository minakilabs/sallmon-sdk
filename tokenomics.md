# Sallmon SDK: A Playful Yet Innovative Blockchain Project

## Current Development

We are building a **Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain** designed for CPU and GPU mining. Our vision combines the technical rigor of blockchain technology with a sense of humor and fun, creating a unique platform for both developers and enthusiasts.

## Key Features

1. **Mining Fun**:
   - A gamified mining experience that makes the process engaging and entertaining.
   - Challenges and competitions to reward active participants.

2. **Betting Games**:
   - A series of betting and chance games integrated directly into the blockchain ecosystem.
   - Fair and transparent gameplay powered by the blockchain.

3. **Potential Open-World ASCII Game**:
   - An experimental open-world game inspired by **Minecraft**, built with ASCII art for a retro aesthetic.
   - This feature, while not critical, showcases the flexibility and creativity of the Sallmon SDK.

## Technology Stack

Sallmon SDK is built using the **Python Trifecta**:
- **FastAPI**: Powers the backend APIs for speed, scalability, and simplicity.
- **Flask**: Provides flexibility for UI components and microservices.
- **Click**: Used for CLI tools, enabling developers to interact seamlessly with the blockchain.
- **WebSockets (WS)**: Ensures real-time interactions, crucial for games and live features.

## Why We Did This

At **MinakiLabs**, we specialize in **custom blockchain solutions** from end to end. Decentralized applications (DApps) represent the most fun and fulfilling software development we’ve ever experienced. Being able to write DApps feels like a privilege, combining creative expression with cutting-edge technology.

### We undertook this project because:

1. **Passion for Blockchain**:  
   Building decentralized systems is not just work for us; it’s a joy. This project allows us to explore, innovate, and share our love for blockchain technology.

2. **A Creative Outlet**:  
   Sallmon SDK isn’t just a blockchain—it’s a platform for creativity. From games to quirky mining experiences, it’s a playground for innovation.

3. **Personal Fulfillment**:  
   Even if it’s just for ourselves or for fun, this work brings immense satisfaction. We feel lucky to do what we love every day.

## Conclusion

Sallmon SDK embodies the spirit of innovation and humor. Whether you’re a miner, a developer, or just someone looking for a fun blockchain experience, **Sallmon SDK** offers something unique. Built with passion, powered by Python, and driven by the community, this project is a testament to the joy of creating decentralized applications.
