With its unique branding centered around a quirky “dog-fish” mascot, Sallmon SDK aims to blend humor with functionality, offering a lighthearted approach to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

	4.	Meme-Ready Aesthetic
The entire project embraces its meme origins with vibrant, comical visuals, including the mascot, coin design, and UI/UX of the platform. It’s designed to evoke humor while maintaining professional-grade blockchain technology.
	5.	Open-Source Philosophy
Sallmon SDK is open source, encouraging developers to contribute to its growth, add features, and share innovations.
	6.	Community Focus
