🌟 Project Description: Sallmon CORE - The Meme Blockchain

Welcome to Sallmon CORE, where blockchain meets creativity, and your CPU/GPU gets a workout worthy of a dogfish chasing its tail upstream. We’ve combined cutting-edge blockchain functionality with the whimsy of aquatic memes to create a Python-based utility network like no other. Yes, it’s fun, but make no mistake—beneath the playful scales lies serious tech.

📦 Installation
Getting Sallmon CORE up and running is easier than teaching a dogfish new tricks. Just run:

pip install sallmon-core

❌ Uninstallation
If you ever need to bid farewell to Sallmon CORE, we won’t take it personally. Remove it with:

pip uninstall sallmon-core

📖 Source Code Access
Our source code is available on request. But why not flex your gills and try building your own core software? Think of it as a rite of passage in the blockchain ocean. Successfully launch your own? Fantastic! We’ll roll out the red carpet (and maybe a fish tank) to welcome you to our dev team. Let’s swim upstream together! 🐟💻
